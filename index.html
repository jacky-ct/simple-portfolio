                Developer to-be at the BBC from September, so I'm no longer
                really looking for jobs like that. Either way, I'm still looking
                for ways to be a better developer so this will hopefully go less
                abandoned in the near future.

                Also a bad climber with aspirations of climbing more and less
                badly, a competitive melee player, and a very unaccompilished
                runner and swimmer, though one of those is definitely for fun
                and the other out of a sense of obligation to myself and my
                body.

                Any developing I do in my own time is generally with the goal of
                understanding the builing blocks of more complicated tools that
                I use at work. You won't see flashy portfolios from me, just use
                of boring tools that do things well and the occasional attempt
                at doing advent of code in a silly language that I don't know
                (often functional).

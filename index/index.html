        Developer to-be at the BBC from September, so I'm no longer really
        looking for jobs like that. Either way, I'm still looking for ways to be
        a better developer so this will hopefully go less abandoned in the near
        future.

        Also a bad climber with aspirations of climbing more and less badly, a
        competitive melee player, and a very unaccompilished runner and swimmer,
        though one of those is definitely for fun and the other out of a sense
        of obligation to myself and my body.

        Any developing I do in my own time is generally with the goal of
        understanding the builing blocks of more complicated tools that I use at
        work. You won't see flashy portfolios from me, just use of boring tools
        that do things well and the occasional attempt at doing advent of code
        in a silly language that I don't know (often functional).

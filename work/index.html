    Currently working with our CEO to design and implement an MLOps system for
    automatic training and deployment of a model for detecting damage on wind
    turbine blades, with a companion web app for wind turbine technicians to
    report damage on blade images and generate reports for clients.

  <p>
    The technologies I use on a day to day are React/Express/TS/JS for the web
    app, and Tensorflow/Kubeflow pipelines/Python for the ML side of things.

    I'm also currently doing some freelance work for
    <a href="https://www.instagram.com/vella_climbing/">Vella</a> to create a
    storefront with 3D models using threejs, but that's under wraps right now ðŸ¤«

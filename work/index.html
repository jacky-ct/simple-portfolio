        RFS was my first job out of uni and genuinely a great step into the
        world of software development. I got to touch all parts of the stack and
        have real ownership over entire projects, as well as the opportunity to
        manage an intern towards the end of my tenure. In my time here I've
        worked with JS/TS/Bash/Python, as well as manage CI/CD and
        observability, while actually getting to communicate directly with
        execs. I couldn't be more thankful for the friendships and relationships
        I built here, as well as the technical skills I developed.
